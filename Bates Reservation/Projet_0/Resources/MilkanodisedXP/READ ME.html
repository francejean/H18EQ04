I decided to creat Milkanodised 8 mounth ago, after lot of preview the set awaited is now available. But why choose this name ? As you'll see it's because hard disk, folder and device are based on white platic from iMac G5. So that set look gret with theme light themes like Milk. For Toolbar, i decided to make  realistic icons in 32 px and don't use white icons cause they didn't look well with Aqua or other light themes. </p>			<p>To have a complete set I thought that i should included all Apple hardware icons. All these extra icons are photo realistic in 128px. I will update Milkanodised Extra if new product are released by Apple.</p>		  <h2>HOW USE ICONS </h2>		 <p>The icons contained in Milkanodised are available for MAC and PC, to use them just follow these easy step:</p>		 <p class="wow">If you have downloaded Mac OS X version:</p>		 <p>· Right clic on the icon you want change and show info</p>		 <p>· Copy/paste the icon </p>		 <p class="wow">If you have downloaded Pixadex version:</p>		 <p>&middot; Select icons in Pixadex.</p>		 <p>&middot; Drop icons that you want to change in Pixadex</p>		 <p class="wow">If you have downloaded Windows XP version:</p>		 <p>&middot; Icons for Windows are available as .PNG in 128 px </p>		 <h2>TERMS OF USE</h2> 		<p>Milkanodised is Copyrighted&copy; RimshotDesign, Cyril Seillet.</p>		<p>All downloads have to remain in their original states and must not be redistributed without the read-me files accompanying the files.
